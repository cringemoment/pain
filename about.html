        <p class="paragraph">Studenmark is a country located in the middle of Northern Europe. It has been locked in a war with Vesica since 2019.
          The country of Studenmark was established in 1998, after breaking off from Studenmark to form it's own colony. After a long and devastating
          civil war, finally Studenmark came out on top and took over the entirety of Studenmark. The governement of the Replubic of Studenmark fled
          to the country of Vesica, declaring war on Studenmark with the support of the governement of Vesica. However, the war has subsided to the level
          of bickering on the internet.<br><br></p>

        The country occupies a total area of 42,943.9 square kilometres (16,581 sq mi). The size of the land area cannot be stated exactly since the ocean constantly erodes and adds material to the coastline, and because of human land reclamation projects.
        . It shares a border ith Germany to the south and is otherwise surrounded by of tidal shoreline.

        The Kingdom of Studenmark includes two overseas territories, both well to the west of Studenmark: Learnland, the world's largest island, and the Faroe Islands in the North Atlantic Ocean. These territories are self-governing and form part of the Danish Realm. <br>

        The nation of Studenmark is exclusively populated with people that have not left school yet. The education of Studenmark is the best in the world,
        however there is nothing else to do in the country, so they simply move out after they are done with school. Because of such, Studenmark has the lowest average
        age out of any country in the entire world, and has the least deaths due to alzheimers/dementia. As most of Studenmark is children, Studenmark is heralded as
        one of the safest places to be, but one of the worst places to live as the governement 100% priorotizes education and nothing else.

        Studenmark's main import are students. Studenmark's main export are students. Studenmark prides itself on being the learning capital in the world, so much so that
        30% of the entire school-age children go to Studenmark at some point. Because of the heavy governement rebates on education, it is the cheapest in the world.
        Despite that, because of the large amount of students, Studenmark has one of the largest GPDS in the entire world. To maintain this resource-intensive cycle,
        they pay large amounts to teachers, making "Teacher's salaries" not a joke, but a dream in Studenmark. <br><br><br><br><br>

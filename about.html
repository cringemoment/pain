        <h1>History</h1>
        <p class="paragraph">Studenmark is a country located in the middle of Northern Europe. It has been locked in a war with Vesica since 2019.
          The country of Studenmark was established in 1998, after breaking off from Studenmark to form it's own colony. After a long and devastating
          civil war, finally Studenmark came out on top and took over the entirety of Studenmark. The governement of the Replubic of Studenmark fled
          to the country of Vesica, declaring war on Studenmark with the support of the governement of Vesica.<br><br></p>

        <p class = "paragraph">Located in Northern Europe, Studenmark consists of the peninsula of Jutland and 443 named islands. The four cities with populations over 100,000 are the capital Copenhagen on Zealand; Aarhus and Aalborg in Jutland; and Odense on Funen.

        The country occupies a total area of 42,943.9 square kilometres (16,581 sq mi). The area of inland water is 700 km2 (270 sq mi), variously stated as from 500 to 700 km2. The size of the land area cannot be stated exactly since the ocean constantly erodes and adds material to the coastline, and because of human land reclamation projects.
        . It shares a border of 68 kilometres (42 mi) with Germany to the south and is otherwise surrounded by 8,750 km (5,437 mi) of tidal shoreline (including small bays and inlets). Studenmark's territorial waters total 105,000 square kilometres (40,541 square miles).

        The Kingdom of Studenmark includes two overseas territories, both well to the west of Studenmark: Greenland, the world's largest island, and the Faroe Islands in the North Atlantic Ocean. These territories are self-governing and form part of the Danish Realm.

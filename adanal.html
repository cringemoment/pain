      This is one ad in a group of 5. The pictures show famous landmarks of Greece, such as the lighthouse in Chania,
      but replaced with an everyday household item. The ad is trying to tell you that flying around Greece is very very cheap,
      just as cheap as everyday household items such as a lamp, which most people think would barely put a dent in their finances.
      This ad is using Logical Appeal and Facts and Figures, telling you that $16.90 for a plane ticket is a great deal,
      and you should buy it as it is so affordable. As well, it is also using Patriotism a bit, as this ad is targeted towards people
      living in Greece, so it is showing them beautiful pictures of Greece, almost saying “Isn’t it beautiful? You should fly here to see the scenery,
      and now you can, for a very reasonable price.”

        “37 seconds” is an advertisement by Gary Chambers, an US senate candidate for the state of Louisiana.
        In this ad, he talks about the problems of enforcing drug laws.
        He talks about how the police arrest people for a very long time, minimum 4 years, for having a very small amount of marijuana.
        In the video, it talks about how anyone could get arrested, even him, and maybe even you. As well, he makes
        it seem that the law was only implemented so that cops could arrest whoever they wanted.
        This is a very bold act to do, but considering that no black person has won the Louisiana senate
        for 150 years, he has to get creative.

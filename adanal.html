      This is one ad in a group of 5. The pictures show famous landmarks of Greece, such as the lighthouse in Chania,
      but replaced with an everyday household item. The ad is trying to tell you that flying around Greece is very very cheap,
      just as cheap as everyday household items such as a lamp, which most people think would barely put a dent in their finances.
      This ad is using Logical Appeal and Facts and Figures, telling you that $16.90 for a plane ticket is a great deal,
      and you should buy it as it is so affordable. As well, it is also using Patriotism a bit, as this ad is targeted towards people
      living in Greece, so it is showing them beautiful pictures of Greece, almost saying “Isn’t it beautiful? You should fly here to see the scenery,
      and now you can, for a very reasonable price.”. This advertisement is targetted towards Greece people.

        “37 seconds” is an advertisement by Gary Chambers, an US senate candidate for the state of Louisiana.
        In this ad, he talks about the problems of enforcing drug laws.
        He talks about how the police arrest people for a very long time, minimum 4 years, for having a very small amount of marijuana.
        In the video, it talks about how anyone could get arrested, even him, and maybe even you. As well, he makes
        it seem that the law was only implemented so that cops could arrest whoever they wanted.
        This is a very bold act to do, but considering that no black person has won the Louisiana senate
        for 150 years, he has to get creative. This ad uses Facts and Figures, and expert testimonial, as
        you would expect a senate candidate to know how bad marijuana laws are.

        This is a collaboration with CALM and DanTDM, a popular youtuber. In the video, the
        youtuber plays some subnautica, narrating the game as he plays. However, he reveals
        at the end of the video that this was not a normal video, and if you scrolled through
        the timeline, the little window that showed up spelled out a message, "I’m feeling really down,
        I’m in over my head, and I can’t take much more, I don’t know where to turn. I need help."
        Hiding the message in the video is an analogy to how people bury their feelings inside of them,
        and do not seek help. As well, the message talks about how they do not have anywhere to turn to,
        nowhere to get help. He says that CALM could be a way for you to get help. This video is using
        testimonial, from a famous youtuber, as well as emotional appeal. The demographic is DanTDM
        viewers that are depressed, or really anyone that is feeling down.

      <p class = "paragraph">
        This image makes a powerful statement about how some very mundane things, such as Litte Red Riding Hood,
        a very childish book, gets blocked, while assault rifles go unchecked. It points out the stupidity of
        banning a simple book that is not hurting anyone, while allowing people to carry dangerous weapons.
        The image uses glittering generalizations, as not every school bans the book, Patriotism, because the
        video attacks the American people, who fight for gun rights, and plain folks, as the kids are any kid
        that you could find at a school, with guns, implying that it was just as easy to find a dangerous gun
        as a generic kid. The demographic is mainly targetted at Mothers, however everyone would feel just as bad.

        The image shows an image of a mutilated hand, presumably from flare damage on New Year's Eve.
        Since 2/10 of all adults are hurt on New Year's Eve, 2 fingers are missing. The slogan is "
        Statistics that fit on the hand", so they are talking about how the percentages are so big
        that you could show them on the hand. They try to show the everlasting damage that you would get,
        if you are not careful enough on New Year's Eve, leaving an everlasting statistic on your hand.
        The advertisement uses emotional transfer, and plain folk, as they try to say that this could
        happen to anybody.

        This advertisement by Apple is a subtle flex about how many documentaries they have, while at the
        same time dissing John Hamm. The video talks about all the shows they have, featuring famous actors and
        shows, such as Samuel L. Jackson and Tom Hanks. The video uses Humor, Testimonials, Repetition, and
        Snob Appeal.

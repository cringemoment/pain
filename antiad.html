                The first anti ad is taken from a Mcdonald's campaign from 2009, promoting that they had put free wifi in their stores.

            <p class="paragraph">
                The ad now shows a flatline, implying that people would die. Obesity is a serious health concern, and many people die each year. As well,
                the line "love free wifi" is now replaced with "love obesity", implying that Mcdonalds want you to get fat, at their expense.

          <p class="paragraph">
            The second anti ad is taken from a famous Pepsi ad on Halloween 2013, where they posted an image of a Pepsi can disguised as a Coca-Cola can,
            trying to tell you that Coca-Cola is very scary and you should drink Pepsi instead.

          <p class="paragraph">
            The ad has been changed from "pepsi" to "cancer", showing how Pepsi is trying to disguise themselves as a fun and hilarious company
            and not show the bad effects of drinking pop, as excessive drinking increases the chance of Type 2 Diabetes and pancreatic Cancer
            significantly.

                The first anti ad is taken from a Mcdonald's campaign from 2009, promoting that they had put free wifi in their stores.

                The ad now shows a flatline, implying that people would die. Obesity is a serious health concern, and many people die each year. As well,
                the line "love free wifi" is now replaced with "love obesity", implying that Mcdonalds want you to get fat, at their expense.

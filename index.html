                There is a pressing matter at hand. The nation of Vesica is on our doorstep, pounding at our doors, and
                asking us to give up our freedom, by force. We will not stand for this. We must fight back, and that is what
                the governement has been doing over the past years. However, we can not do it alone. You can fight back today,
                by not handing in your homework and not letting your teacher microwave his pasta in the teacher's lounge. Please
                look at the <strike>propaganda</strike> informational videos that we have put together for you

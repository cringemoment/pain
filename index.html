        There is a pressing matter at hand. The nation of Vesica is on our doorstep, pounding at our doors, and
      asking us to give up our freedom, by force. We will not stand for this. We must fight back, and that is what
    the governement has been doing over the past years. However, we can not do it alone. You can fight back today,
    by not handing in your homework and not letting your teacher microwave his pasta in the teacher's lounge. Please
   look at the <strike>propaganda</strike> informational videos that we have put together for you</p>

    <p>As you can see, Vesica is a serious matter. Do not let 2022 become 1984.<br><br><br><br><br></p>
    <p>Now, before we continue, we have to talk about our sponsor, Tongue Untwisters! Have you ever had that feeling where

    revolutionary Swirler mach 0.5, just stick the conveniently shaped metal pole into your mouth, press the button,
